# SWC
SWC is a Rust-based high-performance JavaScript and TypeScript compiler designed as a faster alternative to traditional tools like Babel and Webpack. It is known for its speed and efficiency, making it an ideal choice for modern web development projects requiring fast build times and efficient code transformation. SWC is optimized for speed and can handle large codebases quickly, often outperforming Babel in terms of compilation time. It is also more memory-efficient due to Rust's memory management features, allowing it to handle large files and complex transformations without consuming excessive memory. SWC is suitable for modern JavaScript and TypeScript projects, but may be necessary for projects requiring custom Babel plugins or legacy support.
